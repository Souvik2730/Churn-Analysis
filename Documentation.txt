## ⚙️ Action  

### 🔹 SQL Database & Queries  
- Created **SQL tables** for customers, subscriptions, transactions, logins, and support tickets.  
- Wrote **queries** to:  
  - Calculate **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**.  
  - Identify **active vs. churned customers** month-over-month.  
  - Perform **cohort analysis** to track retention trends.  
- Built **views** for easy churn tracking and active customer monitoring.  

### 🔹 Python Analysis  
- Used **pandas** and **numpy** for data wrangling.  
- Performed **Cohort Analysis** (grouping customers by signup month to measure retention).  
- Applied **churn risk scoring** to classify customers into **Low, Medium, and High Risk** segments.  
- Built **visualizations** with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to highlight churn patterns, engagement trends, and churn by region/plan.  

### 🔹 Power BI Dashboard  
- Designed an **interactive dashboard** to showcase:  
  - Churn rate trends  
  - Retention by region & plan  
  - Cohort-based retention analysis  
  - Customer segmentation (low/medium/high risk)  
- Enabled **drill-down capabilities** for decision-makers to explore detailed customer insights.
